# Netlify Deployment Fix - CVE-2025-55182 ✅

## Issue
Netlify deployment was failing with error:
```
You're currently using a version of Next.js affected by a critical security vulnerability. 
To protect your project, we're blocking further deploys until you update your Next.js version.
Refer to https://ntl.fyi/cve-2025-55182 for more information.
```

## Root Cause
The project was using Next.js 14.2.32, which has a critical security vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182).

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Updated Next.js Version
✅ Updated from 14.2.32 to 14.2.35 (latest stable, patched version)  
✅ Pinned to exact version (removed caret `^`) to prevent version drift  
✅ Verified with `npx fix-react2shell-next` - No vulnerabilities found  

### 2. Package.json Changes
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "14.2.35"  // Changed from "^14.2.30" → "14.2.35" (exact version)
  }
}
```

### 3. Verification
```bash
# Check installed version
npm list next
# Output: next@14.2.35 ✅

# Run vulnerability scanner
npx fix-react2shell-next
# Output: No vulnerable packages found! ✅

# Build test
npm run build
# Output: ✓ Compiled successfully (58 pages) ✅
```

### 4. Git Commits
```bash
# Commit 1: Update Next.js to 14.2.35
git commit -m "Update Next.js to 14.2.35 to fix CVE-2025-55182 security vulnerability"

# Commit 2: Pin to exact version
git commit -m "Pin Next.js to exact version 14.2.35 (remove caret)"

# All changes pushed to GitHub ✅
```

## Next Steps for Netlify Deployment

### IMPORTANT: Clear Netlify Build Cache

Netlify may still have the old Next.js version cached. You MUST clear the cache:

#### Option 1: Clear Cache via Netlify UI (Recommended)
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com
2. Select your site
3. Go to **Deploys** tab
4. Click **Trigger deploy** dropdown
5. Select **"Clear cache and deploy site"**
6. Wait for build to complete

#### Option 2: Clear Cache via Site Settings
1. Go to **Site settings** → **Build & deploy**
2. Scroll to **Build settings**
3. Click **"Clear build cache"**
4. Then go to **Deploys** tab
5. Click **"Trigger deploy"** → **"Deploy site"**

#### Option 3: Delete and Reconnect Site (Last Resort)
If cache clearing doesn't work:
1. Note your environment variables
2. Delete the site from Netlify
3. Create new site from GitHub repo
4. Re-add environment variables
5. Deploy

### Verify Netlify Build Settings

Ensure these settings are correct in Netlify:

**Build Settings:**
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `.next`
- Node version: 18.x or higher

**Environment Variables Required:**
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_key
CEREBRAS_API_KEY=your_key (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key (optional)
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Netlify Still Shows CVE Error

**Problem**: Netlify build cache may still contain old Next.js version

**Solutions**:
1. ✅ Clear cache and redeploy (see steps above)
2. ✅ Check that GitHub repo shows Next.js 14.2.35 in package.json
3. ✅ Verify Netlify is connected to correct repository
4. ✅ Check Netlify build logs for actual Next.js version being used

### If Build Succeeds But Site Doesn't Work

**Problem**: Browser cache or service worker issues

**Solutions**:
1. Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Clear service worker: DevTools → Application → Service Workers → Unregister
3. Open in incognito/private window

### If Different Repository Error

**Problem**: Error mentions `SOHAM-focus` instead of `CODEEX-AI-`

**Solution**: 
- Verify you're deploying the correct repository
- Check Netlify site settings → Build & deploy → Repository
- Ensure it points to: `https://github.com/Heoster/CODEEX-AI-`
