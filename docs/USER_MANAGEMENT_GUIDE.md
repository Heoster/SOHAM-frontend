### 3. Security Features

#### Re-authentication
For sensitive operations (email change, password change), the system requires re-authentication:

2. System verifies your identity
3. Proceed with the requested change

This prevents unauthorized changes if someone gains temporary access to your device.

#### Email Verification
- New email addresses require verification
- Verification emails are sent automatically
- Check your inbox and spam folder

### 4. Password Requirements

- Minimum 6 characters
- Must match confirmation when changing
- Current password required for changes

### 5. Email Change Process

1. Navigate to User Management → Profile tab
2. Enter new email address
3. Click "Update" button
4. Enter current password for verification
5. Receive verification email at new address
6. Click verification link to complete change

### 6. Password Change Process

1. Navigate to User Management → Security tab
2. Enter new password (min 6 characters)
3. Confirm new password
4. Click "Update Password"
5. Enter current password for verification
6. Password updated successfully

### 7. Account Deletion

⚠️ **Warning**: This action is irreversible!

1. Navigate to User Management → Danger Zone tab
2. Click "Delete My Account"
3. Type "DELETE" to confirm
4. All data will be permanently deleted

## Troubleshooting

### "Please sign out and sign in again"
This error occurs when your session is too old for sensitive operations. Simply:
1. Sign out
2. Sign in again
3. Retry the operation

### Email Not Received
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify email address is correct
- Wait a few minutes for delivery
- Contact support if issue persists

### Password Reset Not Working
- Ensure you're using the correct email
- Check spam folder for reset email
- Contact support at codeex@email.com

## Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Minimum 6 characters, mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
2. **Verify Email**: Complete email verification for account recovery
3. **Regular Updates**: Update password periodically for security
4. **Secure Sign Out**: Always sign out on shared devices

## API Integration

For developers integrating with SOHAM:

### Firebase Auth Service
Located at `src/lib/firebase-auth-service.ts`

Available methods:
- `sendPasswordReset(email)`: Send password reset email
- `changeEmailWithVerification(user, newEmail)`: Change email with verification
- `updateUserPassword(user, newPassword)`: Update password
- `reauthenticateUser(user, password)`: Re-authenticate for sensitive operations
- `sendVerificationEmail(user)`: Send email verification

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { firebaseAuthService } from '@/lib/firebase-auth-service';
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';

// Send password reset
const result = await firebaseAuthService.sendPasswordReset('user@example.com');
if (result.success) {
  console.log('Reset email sent');
}

// Change password (requires re-authentication first)
const auth = getAuth();
const user = auth.currentUser;

if (user) {
  // Re-authenticate
  const reauthResult = await firebaseAuthService.reauthenticateUser(user, 'currentPassword');
  
  if (reauthResult.success) {
    // Update password
    const updateResult = await firebaseAuthService.updateUserPassword(user, 'newPassword');
    console.log(updateResult.message);
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Storage**: Passwords are never stored in plain text
2. **Re-authentication**: Required for sensitive operations
3. **Email Verification**: Ensures account ownership
4. **Session Management**: Automatic timeout for inactive sessions
5. **Provider Security**: Google Sign-In uses OAuth 2.0
