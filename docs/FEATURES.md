### How to Select a Model

1. **Desktop**: Click the model dropdown in Settings
2. **Mobile**: Tap the model button to open the bottom sheet selector
3. **Auto Mode**: Select "Auto" to let the AI choose the best model

---

## Smart Auto-Routing

When you select "Auto" mode, SOHAM automatically analyzes your query and routes it to the most appropriate model.

### How It Works

1. **Query Classification**: Your message is analyzed for keywords and patterns
2. **Category Detection**: The system identifies if your query is about:
   - Coding (programming, debugging, algorithms)
   - Math (calculations, equations, statistics)
   - Conversation (greetings, casual chat)
   - Multimodal (images, visual content)
   - General (everything else)
3. **Model Selection**: The best available model for that category is selected
4. **Fallback**: If the preferred model is unavailable, a fallback is used

### Classification Patterns

**Coding Detection:**
- Keywords: code, function, debug, error, algorithm, API, database
- Languages: JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Java, etc.
- Code blocks in messages

**Math Detection:**
- Keywords: calculate, solve, equation, formula, derivative
- Mathematical expressions: +, -, *, /, ^, =
- Math functions: sin, cos, log, sqrt

**Conversation Detection:**
- Greetings: hello, hi, hey, good morning
- Social phrases: how are you, thank you, please

### Model Attribution

Every AI response shows:
- **Model Name**: Which model generated the response
- **Category Icon**: Visual indicator of the model type
- **Auto Badge**: Shows if auto-routing was used
- **Reasoning**: Hover/tap for explanation of model selection
